recruitAce 

RecruitAce is a mobile application designed for recruiters to connect with the most qualified candidates for their teams, based on both skills and requirements. 

The current version of the app includes fundamental features like creating, editing, deleting, and viewing job posts. 

In the future, we plan to enhance the app by adding search functionalities that will enable recruiters to  filter candidates based on their skills. Futhermore, we aim to implement a messaging system that allows direct communication between recruiters and candidates.
